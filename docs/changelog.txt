- qaqc_automation.R: added time/gap, location, gross range, climatological, spike, and rate of change tests

2021-10-13  Brendan Turley
- qaqc_automation.R: added outline for QAQC methods based upon IOOS recommendations

2021-10-06  Brendan Turley
- aquatroll_processing.R: data_extract_aquatroll includes input filename in output; interp_aquatroll plots filename for reference

2021-10-05  Brendan Turley
- aquatroll_processing.R: interp_aquatroll function changed to deal with NAs during smooth, bin, and interpolation process because smooth.spline functino does not accept NAs; future addition possible to use upcast data if downcast is bad/unacceptable

2021-10-04  Brendan Turley
- aquatroll_processing.R: remove process_aquatroll function; it was redundant with newer functions performing the same operations more efficiently; fixed chlorophyll dropout replacement in interp_aquatroll function; changed 'too few data' stop to a warning and added else statement to prevent full stop
- process_aquatroll.R: depreciated function moved to new folder

2021-10-01  Brendan Turley
- aquatroll_processing.R: added aquatroll_fields helper function that lists standard aquatroll output parameters

2021-09-30  Brendan Turley
- aquatroll_processing.R: interp_aquatroll function option save_plot

2021-09-29  Brendan Turley
- aquatroll_processing.R: interp_aquatroll now saves current working directory so it returns to htm locations after saving profile plots in different directory

2021-09-27  Brendan Turley
- aquatroll_processing.R: fix interp_aquatroll so it does not look for profile index and now includes lat/lon as output; update bottom_finder funciton so output can be used as a polygon without extra processing
- FCWC_vignette.R: updated wored example to produce interpolated profiles (with colorbars!)

2021-09-24  Brendan Turley
- aquatroll_processing.R: update data_extract_aquatroll to export numeric columns because direct pipe into interp_aquatroll was causing errors; update interp_aquatroll to no longer recognize profile index column, which I added in a processing step outside these defined functions
- added FCWC_vignette.R to show example processing pipeline; this is a work in progress

2021-09-23  Brendan Turley
- aquatroll_processing.R: update function parameter listings; update interp_aquatroll to plot interpolated data for inspection

2021-09-22  Brendan Turley
- aquatroll_processing.R: added new interpolation function interp_aquatroll to replace old function process_aquatroll

2021-09-20  Brendan Turley
- aquatroll_processing.R: removal of depreciated and redundant functions dropout_aquatroll, process_htm, summary_aquatroll, summary_htm

2021-07-30  Brendan Turley
- aquatroll_processing.R: fixed error coding characters for spltstr function; added bottom finder function and breaks function

2021-08-02  Brendan Turley
- aquatroll_processing.R: added new smoothing, depth binning, and interpolation method

2021-08-11  Brendan Turley
- aquatroll_processing.R: added conversion from depth in feet to meters; reorder columns to be consistent

2021-08-13  Brendan Turley
- aquatroll_processing.R: created new functions to process either csv or htms
